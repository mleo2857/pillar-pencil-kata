# pillar-pencil-kata

This is my solution to the Pencil Durability kata

Instructions for this kata can be found here: https://github.com/PillarTechnology/kata-pencil-durability

I wrote this using Ruby and the tests were run using the ruby minitest unit testing framework.

The test file can be run from the command line using "ruby pencil_test.rb" from the spec directory.
