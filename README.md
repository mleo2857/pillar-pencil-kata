# pillar-pencil-kata
This is my solution to the Pencil Durability kata

I wrote this using Ruby and the tests were run using the ruby minitest unit testing framework.

The test file can be run from the command line using "ruby pencil_test.rb" from the spec directory.

If there are any issues please contact me through github or my email at mleo2857@gmail.com
